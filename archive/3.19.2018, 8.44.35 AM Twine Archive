As well as the worlds highest mountains some of the biggest rivers flow from the Himalayas: the Indus, the Ganges and the Tsangpo-Brahmaputra.

The Himalayas have a big effect on the climate of the region. They keep the monsoon rains on the Indian plain and limit rainfall on the Tibetan plateau.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="India" tags="" position="604,533">The Indian Himalayan Region is the section of the Himalayas within India.

It starts from the foothills of the south and extends up to Tibetan plateau in the north.

Mighty old streams like the Indus, Sutlej, Kali, Kosi and Brahmaputra have cut through steep gorges to escape into the Great Plains.

￼The Himalays were formed 40 to 50 million years ago when India crashed into the Asian plate.

With an 8,850 metre summit it is the tallest mountain in the world.

Molly Hughes is the youngest woman to climb Mount Everest and to climb both sides.

She climbed the south side in 2012 when she was 21 and the north side in 2017 at the age of 26.

Everest grows by half a centimeter every year.

The temperature can be -62 C.

In mid May each year, the jet stream moves north causing the winds the calm and temperatures to warm enough for people to try to summit. This is called the &#x27;summit window&#x27;.

Everest is called Chomolungma by the Tibetan people. It means mother goddess of the universe.

Like all mountains around the world the local indigenous people were the first to see it.

The wind can blow over 200 mph.
